								**Final Project Proposal**


	For my final project for this class, I hope to utilize Cinder well enough to make a game somewhat similar to one of my favorite mobile games of all time, Head Soccer. Head Soccer is a mobile game in which two players face off, using their heads and movement mechanisms to try and hit the ball into each other’s goal. The main movement mechanisms are right, left, and up, which can easily be mirrored by WASD and the arrow keys in order for two players to play against each other.
	
	I am confident that I would be able to do this project wholeheartedly, as throughout my teenage years I spent a great deal of time playing that game. As a result of this, I would feel fulfillment knowing I replicated — at least to some extent — one of my favorite games. Additionally, creating a game like this will show that I have a decent mastery of C++. Consequently, I would be more easily able to apply for and receive internships, as this could be a potential resume booster. People tend to put more effort into ideas and projects in which they are interested, so this would be something that I would most certainly enjoy doing.
	
	In the first week, I hope to get the actual drawing of the game itself done, as drawing the goals, field, sky, and dynamic players/ball will be somewhat difficult. In the second week, I would like to implement the collision mechanics, as I want the players to have as smooth of collisions with the ball as possible. In the third week, I hope to add somewhat of a goal animation and smooth out any remaining things that may need fixing. Some of the stretch goals are to ensure that player collisions work effectively, create different ball sizes/shapes/designs, and create different sized goals.
