This project is a recreation of the popular game HeadBall2. In HeadBall2, there are two players who can move and hit a soccer ball into a goal. The aim of the game is to score more goals than your opponent.

In this project, there are orange and purple players who move. The orange player moves with the W,A, and D keys and the purple player moves with the left, right, and up arrow keys. When a player jumps up (using either the W or up arrow key), they are moved down with a pseudo-gravitational force. When a player collides with the ball, the ball will take on whatever velocity that player had and move accordingly.
In addition to basic movement, there is a special kick that can be used by either of the players (for orange the kick will be in the rightward direction and for purple the kick will be in the leftward direction). This kick will elevate the ball so as to kick the ball over their opponent, but the opponent can respond accordingly by jumping to hit the ball.
The game runs for a pseudo-90 seconds, and whichever player has more goals by the end of that 90 seconds wins. If neither player scores or both players have the same amount of goals, then the game is declared as a tie.
Shortly after the game is over, everything will reset and another game will commence. Enjoy!
To run this game, you must have Cinder installed on your device.
